# Spotify-Clone
- Spotify Clone Build using React JS and Spotify Developer's tools. 

- App has been deployed and hosted with Firebase at the below URL

https://spotify-clone-5603e.web.app

- The application is entirely complete with an only issue that it does not play the spotify's original songs ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„.It might be because spotify doesn't let other applications play its music ,I searched alot but I couldn't find any API or any other way to play the songs other than this the application is absolutly fine you can yourself visit my application and login with your spotify account (yes you don't have to create acount on my application you can login into my application with your original spoltify account) and I wish you a nice experience .I will definitely be updating it and make it work smoothly very soon.

THANK YOU...
